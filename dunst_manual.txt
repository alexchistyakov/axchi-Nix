NAME
       dunst - a customizable and lightweight notification-daemon

SYNOPSIS
       dunst [-conf file] [-verbosity v] [-print] [--startup_notification]

DESCRIPTION
       Dunst is a highly configurable and lightweight notification daemon.

   Autostarting dunst
       On most installations, dunst should be able to automatically be started by D-Bus when a notification is
       sent. This is not recommended when multiple notification daemons are installed, because D-Bus will not know
       which one to start.  Other ways of autostarting dunst include starting dunst with your desktop environment
       or window manager's autostart functionality or via the provided systemd service.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -h/-help/--help
           List all command line flags

       -conf/-config file
           Use  alternative config file.  This disables the search for other config files.  If it cannot be opened,
           dunst will issue a warning and fall back on its internal defaults.  (Hint: `dunst  -conf  -  </dev/null`
           can be used to enforce the defaults, i.e. for testing)

       -v/-version/--version
           Print version information.

       -verbosity (values: 'crit', 'warn', 'mesg', 'info', 'debug' default 'mesg')
           Do  not  display  log  messages, which have lower precedence than specified verbosity. This won't affect
           printing notifications on the terminal. Use the '-print' option for this.

       -print/--print
           Print notifications to stdout. This might be useful for logging, setting up rules or using the output in
           other scripts.

       -startup_notification/--startup_notification
           Display a notification on startup.

   DEPRECATED OPTIONS
       Old version of dunst allowed changing the colors of different urgencies through command line  options.  This
       has been long removed in favour of RULES, see issue #328.

       -li/ni/ci icon
           Set notification icon.

       -lf/nf/cf color
           Set notification foreground color.

       -lb/nb/cb color
           Set notification background color.

       -lh/nh/ch color
           Set notification highlight color.

       -lfr/nfr/cfr color
           Set notification frame color.

       -lto/nto/cto secs
           Set notification timeout time.

CONFIGURATION
       A           default           configuration           file           is           included          (usually
       /nix/store/q5vrcin2rnf2mcwwn9l1sjylia9i8xm3-dunst-1.12.2/etc/dunst/dunstrc)  and   serves   as   the   least
       important  configuration file. Note: this was previously /usr/share/dunst/dunstrc. You can edit this file to
       change the system-wide defaults or copy it to a more important location to override its  settings.  See  the
       FILES  section  for  more  details  on where dunst searches for its configuration files and how settings get
       applied.

       See dunst(5) for all possible settings.

   NOTIFY-SEND HINTS
       Dunst is able to get different colors for a message via notify-send.  In order to do that you have to add  a
       hint via the -h option.  The progress value can be set with a hint, too.

       See dunst(5) for the list of accepted hints.

       Some examples:

               notify-send -h string:fgcolor:#ff4444

               notify-send -h string:bgcolor:#4444ff -h string:fgcolor:#ff4444 -h string:frcolor:#44ff44

               notify-send -h int:value:42 "Working ..."

MISCELLANEOUS
       Dunst  can  be  paused via the `dunstctl set-paused true` command. To unpause dunst use `dunstctl set-paused
       false`.  Another way is to send SIGUSR1 and  SIGUSR2  to  pause  and  unpause  respectively.  Pausing  using
       dunstctl is recommended over using signals, because the meaning of the signals isn't stable and might change
       in the future.

       When  paused,  dunst  won't  display any notifications, but keeps all notifications in a queue. This can for
       example be wrapped around a screen locker (i3lock, slock) to prevent flickering of notifications through the
       lock, and to read all missed notifications after returning to the computer.

FILES
       These are the base directories dunst searches for configuration files in descending order of importance:

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
               This is the most important directory. ("$HOME/.config" if unset or empty)

       $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
               This, like $PATH for instance, is a :-separated list of base  directories  in  descending  order  of
               importance.  (/nix/store/q5vrcin2rnf2mcwwn9l1sjylia9i8xm3-dunst-1.12.2/etc if unset or empty)

       Dunst will search these directories for the following relative file paths:

       dunst/dunstrc
               This is the base config and as such the least important in a particular base directory.

       dunst/dunstrc.d/*.conf
               These are "drop-ins" (mind the ".d" suffix of the directory).  They are more important than the base
               dunstrc  in  the parent directory, as they are considered to be small snippets to override settings.
               The last in lexical order is the most important one, so you can easily change the order by  renaming
               them.  A common approach to naming drop-ins is to prefix them with numbers, i.e.:

                   00-least-important.conf
                   01-foo.conf
                   20-bar.conf
                   99-most-important.conf

               Only files with the .conf suffix will be read.

       Only  settings  from  the last base config the corresponding drop-ins get applied.  So if a dunstrc is first
       found in ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc, drop-ins will be searched in ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc.d/*. Settings in more
       important files override those in less important ones.
